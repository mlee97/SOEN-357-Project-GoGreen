## Objectives

Starting a sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle can be intimidating. While more and more people want to make environmentally conscious decisions, finding places to achieve such a task can be challenging unless you have someone to help you start out. GoGreen allows anyone to find places near them that promote sustainability and offer products or services that are environmentally friendly. Not only does it help average people contribute to this cause, but it also brings exposure to businesses that are making an effort to help protect our planet.

## Technologies
